# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consdier the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

A brief example for each question is included for the 
[Traveling Salesman Problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

The technical problem is to train an RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine) to learn information about the H2 molecule and Rydberg atoms, specifically how the potential energy stored in the H2 molecule varies as the distance between the H atoms changes.

There is a chemical bond between the two atoms and there is a force of attraction and replusion between these two atoms. The balance between these two forces determines the distance that separates the atoms in a chemical bond (called the bond length).

The potential energy stored in the molecule can be plotted as a function of the two atoms' separation r. The attractive and repulsive forces will be in equilibrium at the very minimum point on the curves.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

A few types of real world problems this solution can solve involves drug development, materials research and study of the natural processes that can lead to improvements in fertilizer and chemical manufacturing.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

A few potential customers for this solution include :

1) Optima Chemical https://optimachem.com/development-services/
2) GVK Bio https://www.gvkbio.com/chemical-development-services/
3) Anuvia Plant Nutrients https://www.anuviaplantnutrients.com/

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language
